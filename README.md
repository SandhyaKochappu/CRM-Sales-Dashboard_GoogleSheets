# CRM-Sales-Dashboard_GoogleSheets

An interactive dashboard for Sales Managers to track their team's quarterly performance in Google Sheets
Situation
Performing quarterly sales analysis for a company specializing in selling computer hardware to large businesses. The company has just implemented a new CRM system to track sales opportunities, but has no visibility of the data outside of the platform.
Task
Built an interactive dashboard that enables sales managers to track their team’s quarterly performance.
Objectives
1.	Data preparation
2.	Data exploration with pivot tables
•	Insert a pivot table on a new table on a new tab to show opportunities won by quarter.
•	Add another pivot table on the same sheet to break down the percentage of won & lost opportunities by quarter.
•	Create a final pivot table that shows the opportunities won by quarter for each sales agent, and sort the sales agents in descending order by opportunities won.
•	Restructure the first two pivot tables so they have the quarters as pivot table columns(not rows), and sort them so the most recent quarter always comes first.
3.	Build a dynamic dashboard
•	Insert a scorecard chart visual to show the opportunities won for the most recent quarter(2017-Q4) compared to the previous one (2017-Q3).
•	Use a pie chart to show the opportunities won & lost in the most recent quarter.
•	Use a bar chart to visualise the opportunities won by the sales agent for the most recent quarter
•	Add slicers for the regional office and manager fields.
•	Finish by arranging the visuals into a dashboard and adding a title.
