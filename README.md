# CRM-Sales-Dashboard_GoogleSheets

An interactive dashboard for Sales Managers to track their team's quarterly performance in Google Sheets<br/> 
**Situation**<br/> 
Performing quarterly sales analysis for a company specializing in selling computer hardware to large businesses. The company has just implemented a new CRM system to track sales opportunities, but has no visibility of the data outside of the platform.<br/> 
**Task**<br/> 
Built an interactive dashboard that enables sales managers to track their team’s quarterly performance.<br/> 
**Objectives**<br/> 
1.	Data preparation<br/> 
2.	Data exploration with pivot tables<br/> 
•	Insert a pivot table on a new table on a new tab to show opportunities won by quarter.<br/> 
•	Add another pivot table on the same sheet to break down the percentage of won & lost opportunities by quarter.<br/> 
•	Create a final pivot table that shows the opportunities won by quarter for each sales agent, and sort the sales agents in descending order by opportunities won.<br/> 
•	Restructure the first two pivot tables so they have the quarters as pivot table columns(not rows), and sort them so the most recent quarter always comes first.<br/> 
3.	Build a dynamic dashboard<br/> 
•	Insert a scorecard chart visual to show the opportunities won for the most recent quarter(2017-Q4) compared to the previous one (2017-Q3).<br/> 
•	Use a pie chart to show the opportunities won & lost in the most recent quarter.<br/> 
•	Use a bar chart to visualise the opportunities won by the sales agent for the most recent quarter<br/> 
•	Add slicers for the regional office and manager fields.<br/> 
•	Finish by arranging the visuals into a dashboard and adding a title.<br/> 
**Key Insights:**<br/> 
•	Sales Conversion Rate: In Quarter 4, 60.25% of opportunities were successfully converted into sales, reflecting ongoing efforts to drive conversion effectiveness.<br/> 
•	Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison: Compared to the previous quarter, there were 61 fewer opportunities converted into sales, highlighting a potential area for further analysis and improvement.<br/>
